# etch-a-sketch
# I made an etch a sketh webpage that follows the user's mouse and draws along a grid. I added buttons to change colors and also set the grid to the desired size. The theme I chose was based on the album Loveless by My Bloody Valentine which I was listening to while creating this project.
